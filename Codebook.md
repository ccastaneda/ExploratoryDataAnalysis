##Data description:
<p>
Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute
sampling rate over a period of almost four years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.</p>

<p>The following is a description of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from 
the UCI web site:</p>
<ol type ="1">
<li><b>Date</b>: date in the format dd/mm/yyyy</li>
<li><b>Time</b>: time in the format hh:mm:ss</li>
<li><b>Global_active_power</b>: household global minute-averaged active power (in Kilowatt)</li>
<li><b>Global_reactive_power</b>: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)</li>
<li><b>Voltage</b>: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)</li>
<li><b>Global_intensity</b>: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)</li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_1</b>:energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt hour of active energy). It
corresponds to the kitchen containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a 
microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).</li>

<li><b>Sub_metering_2</b>:energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt hour of active energy). It
corresponds to the laundry room containing a washing machine, a tumble-drier, 
a refrigerator and a light.</li>

<li><b>Sub_metering_3</b>:energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt hour of active energy). It
corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditio.</li>
</ol>
